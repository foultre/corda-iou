/**
 * The IOU State object, with the following properties:

 * - [lender] The lending party.
 * - [borrower] The borrowing party.
 * - [contract] Holds a reference to the [IOUContract]
 * - [paid] Records how much of the [amount] has been paid.
 * - [linearId] A unique id shared by all LinearState states representing the same agreement throughout history within
 *   the vaults of all parties. Verify methods should check that one input and one output share the id in a transaction,
